Each button should give a value to build a string...

i.e.: 
	"1" + "-" + "1"
	The user hits the one button, then the minus button, then the one button again
	Next, the user should hit the equals button to actually calculate the result.
	Result: "0"

So what function should run when each button is pushed?
At the start of the program we should initialize a string...
Each button should have a press function...

i.e.:
	function onePress() {
		final += "1";
	}
	
	Now this should work if the user clicks multiple numbers, and we can divide the string by the operators and run the actual algorithm...
	The result should ALWAYS look somewhat like the example I gave at the top...
	"1" + "-" + "1"
	In this case - final would equal "1+1"... so how would we actual do the math?
	
	We need a function to take the string as an input, and do the calculation...
	
	My thoughts - we check what operator the string contains... then split the string by that operator and calculate the two sides together
	
	function calculateResult(string result) {
		if(result.includes("+") == true) {
			var answer = 0;
		   result.split("+"); //This will return an array with the two values we need: reult[0] and result[1]
		   answer = parseInt(result[0]) + parseInt(result[1]);
		   return answer; //or set answer to a certain div id and display on calculator screen 
		}
	}

	My logic worked exactly how I had hoped!
	This project was a huge success - I hard coded the javaScript and found a tutorial online for the HTML and CSS (to save time since my goal was only to make the algorithm)
	
	My main goal for this project was to push my knowledge of JS and see exactly how far it would stretch...
	I am impressed with myself... this is the first project of many! :)
	
	While doing research I found a built in JS function called "eval()" that would have taken my original string and done the math... so while my project works, there are always better solutions - at least 
	I learned this for next time.
